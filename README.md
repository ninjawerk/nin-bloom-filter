## About

A Bloom Filter is a space-efficient probabilistic data structure used to test whether an element is a member of a set.

It can quickly check membership with very little memory.

False positives are possible (it may say an element exists when it doesnâ€™t), but false negatives never occur (it will never miss an element that was added).

Commonly used in databases, caching, and network systems where speed and memory efficiency are important.

## Usage

Import the Bloom Filter class and create a new instance:

```ts
import { BloomFilter } from "my-bloom-filter";

// Create a Bloom Filter
// size: number of bits in the filter
// hashCount: number of hash functions to use
const filter = new BloomFilter(100, 3);

// Add elements to the filter
filter.add("apple");
filter.add("banana");

// Check if elements might be in the filter
console.log(filter.contains("apple")); // true
console.log(filter.contains("banana")); // true
console.log(filter.contains("grape")); // false (or true: false positive)
```
